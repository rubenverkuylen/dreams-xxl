              Dreams present themselves as cinematic experiences. Dreams are
              fantastical expressions of our unconscious drives. Whatever we
              repress, leaks through the cracks of the night, into our minds.
              They are mysterious juxtapositions of displaced subjects and
              objects. We generate doubling, multiplying selves, mirror images,
              metamorphosis, bodily disintegration. Stretched, expanded, zoomed
              realities. Discontinuous narratives, fragmented projections.
              Dreams draw landscapes of possibilities. It is within the
              architecture of the dream that the past, present and future meet
              in a different time and space.

                      The magpie is one of the most intelligent non-human
                      species, able to distinguish themselves from their
                      reflections. In many cultures, they are linked to
                      superstitions, with the rhyme “One for the Sorrow” that
                      illustrates how their appearances can be a form of
                      fortune-telling. Via the embodiment of the magpie as an
                      allegorical notion to shift away from the human-centered
                      perspective, the film aims to create speculations of
                      possible futures through the eyes of the magpie as a
                      prophet—seer—diviner, reinforced by its mythical qualities
                      retold in folklores and legends.

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      Super Gairdín is a new video work by artists Cóilín
                      O’Connell and Michelle Doyle about divine spirits,
                      landscape, language and nature. Taking cues from the folk
                      horror tradition, the film is set in a desolate garden
                      centre, a space where landscape is held indefinitely. A
                      figure wanders the aisles of saplings, chancing upon a
                      long forgotten rock deity; the Cailleach. The Cailleach is
                      capable of great forces, summoning nature at will and
                      throwing rocks from her apron. She views mankind with
                      hatred and will soon enact her revenge.

                      Grimshader follows the inner monologue of an unnamed
                      protagonist, sent by his boss Bruce Carmichael on a
                      night-time drive with an unknown destination. Is he

                      Chinese restaurant in Stornoway? At this time of night? Or

                      related to the ongoing investigation by Grimshader
                      internal inquires? The dreamlike journey gradually grows

                      Rayner utilizes labour-intensive, hand-drawn stop-motion
                      animations, utilising the methodology of animating to
                      construct fictional narratives to approximate a sense of
                      reality. The works move tonally towards soft-core science
                      fiction, in pursuit of a state of weirdness: a
                      disconnection of understanding coupled with stabilizing
                      scenarios, the artist attempts to visually preview
                      scenarios in order to do the future self a ‘solid’ by
                      predicting obstacles and self-fulfilling cycles. The work
                      looks through an un-reality to something that is close to
                      an anxiousness about the future.

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      to tell me I had appeared in their dream. If a performance
                      can be thought of as an act of appearing to an audience,

                      self into the different shapes and forms of simulation.
                      The narrative evolves as a visual representation of the

                      (Zoem) is a long-term project in which I - through the use
                      of physical actions and interventions - let the narrative
                      qualities of both the desire for knowledge and the urge to
                      maintain ignorance influence the course of the video.
                      During the production I focus on what forms the basis of
                      my artistic practice, namely the interplay between my
                      personal development and its narrative character and that
                      what an artistic practice could be, based on (art)
                      historical notions such as traditions and thus sharing a
                      similar narrative nature.

                      'Meditation On A Landscape' is a video work that reflects
                      on the inherent qualities of a landscape, and how they
                      interact with us in different emotional ways as we move
                      through and past them. Inspired by a personal journey
                      across several borders, along rivers and mountains, in
                      search of a sense of tranquility and a clearer view of
                      self, the work came together as a fluid organism made of
                      sound and image. An organism consisting of short natural
                      impressions, constantly transforming themselves into
                      something new, somewhere between abstraction and
                      figuration. A work about holding on and letting go.

                      How do you visualise present day alienation of social
                      encounters and the longing to connect? Everyone has their
                      story they wanna share and tell. This is a street scene
                      video collage made with my neighbor's, colleagues and
                      housemates, all of them notice something outside of the
                      frame but not each other. This scene is made to make a
                      space with people come together. Since everyone in the
                      video stares at something outside of the frame, they
                      respond on their surrounding and the people watching the

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      In “Out Lookers”, Verena Blok portrays older women who
                      reclaim their space in public. Witnessing these women age
                      while she herself was maturing into womanhood, the
                      dominant Western discourse privileging youthful femininity
                      rendered them slowly invisible. The film uses snippets of
                      candid conversation between the artist and the women about
                      the transitional nature of femininity. At times they speak
                      through a book they love, Olga Tokarczuk's“DriveYour
                      PlowOverTheBonesOfThe Dead” (2009), a bleakly comic
                      mystery novel about a post-menopausal woman who raises
                      fierce questions about human behavior.

                      Questioning power relations generated around and dictated
                      by the camera, Helena Roig Prats (ES/NL) and Moon Baby
                      (ES/NL) expose their experience as sex workers while
                      creating content for Moon Baby’s OnlyFan account. How do
                      we reflect our intimate selves in a camera transmitted to
                      others?

                      The mood of the film is that of a bare theatrical
                      representation that lives only on its characters. A daily
                      street verbal brawl is portrayed in a performative act
                      with no beginning nor end. Seems like somebody is about to
                      fight, but they never get to that, or are they? The scene
                      takes place somewhere for a whatever reason, in a cycled
                      loop of gestures and expressions. Some are watching, some
                      others take pictures, while a woman tries to calm the
                      clash down.
