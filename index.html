              Laak.Club presents its first exhibition, curated with Home Cinema
              & wysiwyg. The first iteration of Laak’s shows will present a
              narrative of selected time-based works, screened in XXL format .
              Dreams present themselves as cinematic experiences. Dreams are
              fantastical expressions of our unconscious drives. Whatever we
              repress, leaks through the cracks of the night, into our minds.
              They are mysterious juxtapositions of displaced subjects and
              objects. We generate doubling, multiplying selves, mirror images,
              metamorphosis, bodily disintegration. Stretched, expanded, zoomed
              realities. Discontinuous narratives, fragmented projections.
              Dreams draw landscapes of possibilities. It is within the
              architecture of the dream that the past, present and future meet
              in a different time and space.

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      Super Gairdín is a new video work by artists Cóilín
                      O’Connell and Michelle Doyle about divine spirits,
                      landscape, language and nature. Taking cues from the folk
                      horror tradition, the film is set in a desolate garden
                      centre, a space where landscape is held indefinitely. A
                      figure wanders the aisles of saplings, chancing upon a
                      long forgotten rock deity; the Cailleach. The Cailleach is
                      capable of great forces, summoning nature at will and
                      throwing rocks from her apron. She views mankind with
                      hatred and will soon enact her revenge.

                      Rayner utilizes labour-intensive, hand-drawn stop-motion
                      animations, utilising the methodology of animating to
                      construct fictional narratives to approximate a sense of
                      reality. The works move tonally towards soft-core science
                      fiction, in pursuit of a state of weirdness: a
                      disconnection of understanding coupled with stabilizing
                      scenarios, the artist attempts to visually preview
                      scenarios in order to do the future self a ‘solid’ by
                      predicting obstacles and self-fulfilling cycles. The work
                      looks through an un-reality to something that is close to
                      an anxiousness about the future.

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      Super Gairdín is a new video work by artists Cóilín
                      O’Connell and Michelle Doyle about divine spirits,
                      landscape, language and nature. Taking cues from the folk
                      horror tradition, the film is set in a desolate garden
                      centre, a space where landscape is held indefinitely. A
                      figure wanders the aisles of saplings, chancing upon a
                      long forgotten rock deity; the Cailleach. The Cailleach is
                      capable of great forces, summoning nature at will and
                      throwing rocks from her apron. She views mankind with
                      hatred and will soon enact her revenge.

                      ABC12 is a 3D animated short film about the journey of the
                      self into the different shapes and forms of simulation.
                      The narrative evolves as a visual representation of the
                      author’s poems, therefore it is enacted, choreographed,
                      and imagined. It is some kind of interdimensional diary
                      breaking the constraints of time and language towards the
                      inner mystery of the synthetic self.

                      of physical actions and interventions - let the narrative
                      qualities of both the desire for knowledge and the urge to
                      maintain ignorance influence the course of the video.
                      During the production I focus on what forms the basis of
                      my artistic practice, namely the interplay between my
                      personal development and its narrative character and that
                      what an artistic practice could be, based on (art)
                      historical notions such as traditions and thus sharing a
                      similar narrative nature.

                      'Meditation On A Landscape' is a video work that reflects
                      on the inherent qualities of a landscape, and how they
                      interact with us in different emotional ways as we move
                      through and past them. Inspired by a personal journey
                      across several borders, along rivers and mountains, in
                      search of a sense of tranquility and a clearer view of
                      self, the work came together as a fluid organism made of
                      sound and image. An organism consisting of short natural
                      impressions, constantly transforming themselves into
                      something new, somewhere between abstraction and
                      figuration. A work about holding on and letting go.

                      The video is an investigation into the archeology of
                      obsolete special effects. It is set in an artificial world
                      inspired by science fiction low budget movies, cult TV
                      series, and Hollywood classics from the 70s and 80s. The
                      consolidated visual metaphor of the cave is used in order
                      to make the viewer transition between two realities. Once
                      on the other side, we meet a fictional character, an old
                      talking rock that lives in a cavern. The rock is musing on
                      all the films seen and that have shaped its own memories.

                      explore the relationship between her birthplace and

                      Affective Dynamics Study Group is a collective devoted to
                      'study' in the Motenian sense, examining issues around
                      interpersonal relations, non-violent communication,
                      vulnerability, complicity and new ways of being and living
                      together. Part consciousness-raising experiential group,
                      part never-ending rehearsal, the collective meets to
                      perform a series of experimental exercises together,
                      borrowed from the fields of somatics, group therapy,
                      activism, and movement practices. The video is based on
                      footage from the study session and interviews with the
                      participants.

                      In “Out Lookers”, Verena Blok portrays older women who
                      reclaim their space in public. Witnessing these women age
                      while she herself was maturing into womanhood, the
                      dominant Western discourse privileging youthful femininity
                      rendered them slowly invisible. The film uses snippets of
                      candid conversation between the artist and the women about
                      the transitional nature of femininity. At times they speak
                      through a book they love, Olga Tokarczuk's“DriveYour
                      PlowOverTheBonesOfThe Dead” (2009), a bleakly comic
                      mystery novel about a post-menopausal woman who raises
                      fierce questions about human behavior.

                      The mood of the film is that of a bare theatrical
                      representation that lives only on its characters. A daily
                      street verbal brawl is portrayed in a performative act
                      with no beginning nor end. Seems like somebody is about to
                      fight, but they never get to that, or are they? The scene
                      takes place somewhere for a whatever reason, in a cycled
                      loop of gestures and expressions. Some are watching, some
                      others take pictures, while a woman tries to calm the
                      clash down.
